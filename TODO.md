		- 10h total vs. 3h estimate
- [x] fix missing month label
- [x] show loader
- [x] pick license
- [x] add link to my website and source code
- [ ] align hover tooltip with level
- [ ] normalize data
- [ ] cash responses
	- UZIS does not reflect `Cache-Control` headers, HTTP caching with `got` is not possible, custom caching mechanism has to be implemented
	- [ ] consider setting `Cache-Control` headers for my API responses to prevent it already in browser; but verify that it works and the endpoint is not hit
- [ ] [lint with standard](https://standardjs.com/)
- [ ] animate sliding hover to right
- [ ] [wrap API to GraphQL](https://graphql.org/blog/rest-api-graphql-wrapper/)
	- [ ] consider also [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql) and [apollo-server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)
	- [ ] [use Relay](https://relay.dev/docs/en/a-guided-tour-of-relay)
